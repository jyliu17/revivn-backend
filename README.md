REVIVN BACKEND

This is the Ruby on Rails for Revivn Tracking. In order to view the whole application, you will need revivn-frontend as well.


Instructions:

1. First clone down this repositiory to your local desktop and open it with your code editor of choice (i.e. VS Code).

2. When you are in this repository, check if your Ruby gems are out of date by running "gem outdated". If you also run "gem update" to update all gems.

3. Run "bundle install" to install all the gems being used.

4. Finally run "rails s" or "rails server" to start up this server.  You be able to access the server on http://localhost:3000 which tell you are on Rails.


You will need REVIVN FRONTEND in tandem to fully run the application.  You can access it here: https://github.com/jyliu17/revivn-frontend
